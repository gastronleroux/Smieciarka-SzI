## Åšmieciarka

A university AI related project implemented with Javascript.  
The goal is to collect all the trash in the village and transport it to the garbage dump using the shortest path possible.

## Live preview

You can access the live preview version of the project [here](https://gastronleroux.github.io/Smieciarka-SzI/).

## Installation and Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open 'index.html' in your browser

## Alghoritms

There are two options to choose from:
1. Dijkstra algorithm - an easy and quick way to decide a path consisting of households closest to the garbage truck. Not the most optimal one.
2. Genetic algorithm - a natural selection inspired algorithm based on mutations, crossovers and selections. It lasts up to 500 generations, but it usually takes way less to produce a more optimized solution than the one provided by the Dijkstra algorithm.

## App Usage

1. Create a path using one of the algorithms.
2. Click start to simulate the whole process.
